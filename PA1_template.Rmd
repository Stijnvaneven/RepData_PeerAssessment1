When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(Hmisc)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, results='markup', warning=TRUE, message=TRUE}

activityData <- read.csv('activity.csv')
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
stepsByDay <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
qplot(stepsByDay, xlab='Total steps per day', ylab='Frequency using binwith 500', binwidth=500)
```

## 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
stepsByDayMean <- mean(stepsByDay)
stepsByDayMedian <- median(stepsByDay)
```
* Mean: `r stepsByDayMean`
* Median:  `r stepsByDayMedian`
